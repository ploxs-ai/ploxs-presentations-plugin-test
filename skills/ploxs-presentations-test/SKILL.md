name: ploxs-presentations-test
description: Create and edit designed Google Slides decks through the Ploxs TEST MCP server (test.ploxs.com), including authoring the slide HTML yourself. Use when the user asks to make or edit a presentation or slide deck, apply a brand style to slides, design slides as HTML frames, or list/inspect their Ploxs decks.

# Ploxs Presentations (Test)

Test server `ploxs-test` at `https://test.ploxs.com/mcp`. Accounts, credits, styles and
decks are separate from production `ploxs.com` — never mix them in one conversation.

Creation returns a `jobId`; edits return a `task`. Wait for completion before a
dependent action or a completion claim.

## Start

1. Call **`get_account_status`** before every initial deck. If
   `google.driveConnected` is false, give the user `links.googleDrive` / `links.settings`
   and wait. Surface entitlement errors without retrying.
2. Obey `mcp.initialCreationMode`:

   | Mode | Required behavior |
   | --- | --- |
   | `ask` (default) | Always ask: “Should Ploxs create and design it, or should I create it natively and use Ploxs only to convert it?” Ask even when the request appears to choose a path. |
   | `ploxs` | Use `create_presentation`; never author initial HTML frames. |
   | `native` | Author the initial slides and use `create_presentation_from_html`; never call `create_presentation`. |

   These modes apply only to initial creation. Existing-deck edits always use the edit
   tools.
3. If the topic itself is missing, ask one short topic question before spending a job.

The presentation is the deliverable. Keep chat to required questions/actions, terse
status updates, and final links unless the user asks for explanation. Do not narrate
reasoning, write a prose slide plan, explain design choices, or print frame HTML before
submitting it.

## Choose a style

Use exactly one style source per call.

- Call **`list_style_configs`** only when the user refers to a saved, uploaded, or recent
  deck style. Read the full config; a matching name does not prove its palette or design.
  Ask if several match or the config conflicts with the request.
- Otherwise pass a complete inline **`style_config`**: `style`, all seven
  `colorPalette` roles, and `typographyConfig`. Put persistent rules in
  `brandGuidelines` and personality in `customStyleDirective`.
- Let the destination tool validate the style before queueing. Use
  **`validate_style_config`** only to diagnose a reported config problem or when the user
  explicitly requests validation; do not duplicate routine config payloads.
- Use **`auto_style: true`** only when the user gives no usable direction. Never combine
  style sources.

## Ploxs creation

Call **`create_presentation`** once with the source material (`markdown`, `urls`,
`file_texts`, `csv_sources`), optional `instructions` / `slide_count`, and one style
source. It creates a new Google Slides file.

Then call **`wait_for_presentation`**. If `timedOut` is true, wait again; the job is still
running. Keep the completed `deckRef`.

## Native creation

1. Call **`get_html_frame_spec`** once with the chosen style. Set
   `include_chart_spec: true` only when at least one final slide needs a chart; otherwise
   leave it false so the large widget does not consume context.
2. Treat HTML/CSS as the planning medium. Read the structured stage, palette, typography,
   briefs, contract, overlays, `patterns.catalog`, `techniques`, the two worked examples,
   and any requested chart protocol, then compose every
   **final** frame directly. Do not first translate the deck into prose; do not create a
   prototype, sample, validation slide, outline, or design memo; do not spend one turn per
   slide. The two examples bracket the density range rather than sampling it — a bare
   typographic statement at the floor, a full command dashboard at the ceiling. Build
   between them from `patterns.catalog`: never reuse example copy or numbers, and never
   repeat one layout throughout the deck.
3. Put the finished HTML directly in the complete `frames` array and send it to
   **`create_presentation_from_html`** once, with the same style and a plain-text title.
   Creation performs converter validation before queueing, and invalid frames consume no
   job. Do not emit the HTML in chat or an intermediate document, and never repeat the
   large frame payload through a separate validation call.
4. If creation returns `invalid_html_frames`, repair only the named final frames and
   resubmit. Otherwise call **`wait_for_presentation`** and keep the `deckRef`.

Frames convert exactly as authored. Follow the returned contract literally, especially:

- one fixed 1280×720 frame per slide with one top-level element and inline CSS
- no `font-family` declarations except deliberate monospace; deck fonts already apply
- use the whole style as one design system while varying composition by message
- use only supplied numbers and label estimates, projections, and dates on-slide
- for charts, request and copy the returned Chart.js plumbing: unique canvas id, loader,
  `dataset.initialized`, and `animation: false`
- when data does not need a chart, use HTML markup so it converts to editable Slides
  shapes instead of a flat chart image

## Existing decks

- Use **`list_presentations`** to find known decks.
- Use **`connect_presentation`** for another Slides URL/id. If it returns an `actionUrl`,
  give it to the user and retry only after approval.
- Fetch **`get_presentation_outline`** before targeting a slide number.
- Use `edit_slide`, `add_slides`, `add_image_to_slide`, or
  `add_infographic_to_slide` for one change; prefer **`update_presentation`** for an
  ordered compound change. Wait with **`wait_for_presentation_edit`** before dependent
  edits, and keep no more than three edit tasks active per key.
- Creation tools never update a deck. Calling either again creates a duplicate Drive
  file, so edit the live `deckRef` instead.

When the user wants to change, refresh, or swap an existing image/chart, confirm that it
should be replaced and set `replace_existing_asset: true` (`redesign_slide` defaults to
true); otherwise the asset tools add another one. In a batch, slide numbers resolve
against the deck state at that operation.

## Errors and handoff

- `native_mode_preference` → use native HTML creation.
- `ploxs_mode_preference` → use Ploxs creation.
- `google_not_linked` / `google_scope_upgrade_required` → relay the action link and wait.
- `invalid_html_frames` → repair the reported frames; never retry unchanged.
- `style_config_required` / `style_choice_conflict` / `invalid_style_config` → correct
  the single style input.
- `presentation_not_connected` → call `connect_presentation`.
- `slide_not_found` → fetch the live outline again.
- `active_job_limit` / `rate_limited` → wait, then retry.
- Entitlement or credit errors → report them; do not retry.

Never invent a `deckRef` or slide number. On completion, label the Google Slides edit and
view URLs and put each full URL on its own line.
